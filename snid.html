                <p> SNID is an experimental patchable drone synth with three main components, a clock divider, sine wave oscillator, 
                    and experimental wave multiplier oscillator.</p>
                <p> The clock divider can be triggered by the sine wave or wave multiplier oscillators or an external voltage source 
                    between 0 and 5 volts. The first two divisions are used to create a square sub oscillator while the slower divisions 
                    from /8 to /4096 are accessible in the patching section as modulation sources.</p>   
                <p>The multiplier oscillator is based on phase distortion synthesis and generates slopes which read through a sine 
                    wavetable. The comparator knob moves between negative and postive values with 0 in the center position. When at 
                    0 the slope is a saw wave which reads through the wavetable linearly outputting a sine wave. At any other comparator 
                    value when the slope is less than that value it will be multiplied by itself resulting in more harmonically complex 
                    and unpredictable waveforms. More information can be 
                    found <a href = "https://github.com/VariableOscillations/SNID" target= "_blank">here</a>.</p>
